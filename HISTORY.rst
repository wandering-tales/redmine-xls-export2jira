Changes
*******

Fixes
*****

0.9.0 (2018-02-11)
------------------

Improvements
************

* Update coverage from 4.5 to 4.5.1

Changes
*******

* Disable possibility to skip dynamic value mapping feature
* Remove printing of issues referenced users at the end of export phase.

  As both static and dynamic value mappings are enabled for user resources,
  the final user doesn't need to be warned for something he consciously did in either case.

Fixes
*****

* Honor value mappings for user resources


0.8.0 (2018-02-10)
------------------

New features
************

* Implemented issue watchers save method
* Implemented issue attachments save method

Changes
*******

* Removed `CUSTOM_` prefix from the resource value mappings setting names

Fixes
*****

* Fixed setting of dynamic resource value mapping when the resource type is defined on a per-project basis
* Removed misleading comment. When a Redmine resource type is mapped to more than one Jira resource type the final user is free to set value mappings across all possible resource type combinations.
* Added default empty dictionary if the resource type mapping setting is not found
* Minor docstring fixes

------------------

Improvements
************

* Added PyCharm IDE configuration and Python Virtual Environments to .gitignore
* Added configuration file with defaults and support for local configuration file
* Minor documentation fixes

Changes
*******

* Dropped out "Redmine XLS Plugin" in favor of Redmine REST API.

  Since the files exported by the plugin lack some information needed to produce files compatible with the Jira Importer Plugin (JIM),
  several calls to the Redmine REST API were needed to compensate the data. Hence to avoid the effort to merge the data coming from
  two difference sources I decided to rely solely on Redmine REST API to fetch all the needed data.

  This is a major project scope change that implied, in turn, the following modifications:

  - Renamed GitHub repository from "redmine-xls-export2jira" to "redmine2jira"
  - Renamed Python package from "redmine_xls_export2jira" to "redmine2jira"
  - Rename project description to "Redmine to JIRA Importers plugin"

  Any other reference to the "Redmine XLS Export" plugin has also been removed from the documentation.

* Removed Python 2.7 compatibility. Added Python 3.6 compatibility.
* Temporarily disable CLI tests

************

* Initial pyup.io update
* Added pyup.io Python 3 badge
